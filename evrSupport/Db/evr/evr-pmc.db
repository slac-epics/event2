# On the PMC version of the EVR there are only 4 trigger outputs, no need to
# enable everything...
#
# Variables:
#	DEV        = Your EVR name
#	TRIG_WIDTH = Width of all triggers generated.
#	TRIG_DELAY = Delay to apply between event and trigger.
# 		WARNING: TRIG_DELAY MUST BE NON-0 IF YOU USE DGX
#	TRIG0_SRC = Source of the first trigger output on the PMC card (see below)
#	TRIG1_SRC = Source of the second trigger output on the PMC card (see below)
#	TRIG2_SRC = Source of the third trigger output on the PMC card (see below)
#
# For the trigger sources (TRIGX_SRC) the following are valid:
# 0 = Extended Delay Trigger 0 (DG0)
# 1 = Extended Delay Trigger 1 (DG1)
# 2 = Extended Delay Trigger 2 (DG2)
# 3 = Extended Delay Trigger 3 (DG3)
# 4 = Trigger 0 (TRG0)
# 5 = Trigger 1 (TRG1)
# 11 = Programmable Width Pulse 0 (OTP0)
# 12 = Programmable Width Pulse 1 (OTP1)
# 13 = Programmable Width Pulse 2 (OTP2)
# 14 = Programmable Width Pulse 3 (OTP3)
# 63 = Disabled
